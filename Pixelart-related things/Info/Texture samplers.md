Types:
- point filter
	- When there's not enough space for two pixels, it takes the color of the pixel, closest to that coordinate
	- When there's too much space, it (again) takes the colors of the pixels closest to those coordinates
- bilinear filter
	- when there's not enough space, it takes the weighted average of the four neighbouring pixels
	- the same goes for the abundance of space
- trilinear filter
	- 
- anisotropic filter
