# Hello there!
I'm glad you have stumbled upon my informational legacy. In this specific vault I have collected a lot of information about pixel art, while also keeping track of personal workflow via checklists and such.
Most of the information was taken from lots of free sources on the internet, although some wordings and conceptions were also taken from a great book i read a while ago called [[Pixel_Logic_-_A_Guide_to_Pixel_Art_by_Michael_Azzi_z-lib_org.pdf|"Pixel Logic"]]

### Back to the topic: where should you start? 
# The basic concepts, of course!
>[!Note]
>Pixel art is a medium like pencil drawing, oil painting and so forth - therefore a lot of concepts from traditional art (like construction or color theory) often translate onto pixel art pieces.

>[!note] Another note
>This vault focuses more on pixel art related concepts and techniques and a bit less on more general artistic concepts. Googling is still a very useful tool at your disposal - don't forget about that!

All the notes have a lot of links and examples, so there should be enough information for you to learn a month or two forward. Don't forget to make breaks between learning - otherwise chances are you will burn out pretty quickly. Plus, while you have a break, try to practice a concept you just learned by making a sprite or two - that way the freshly learned material not only will affix itself in your mind better, but also will help you think of some actual practical usage of it, which is a useful skill in itself.

General artistic concepts worth learning are:
- Color theory
- Shading
- Construction
- Anatomy

Useful basic concepts to begin learning with are:
- [[Dithering]]
- [[AntiAliasing]]
- [[Clusters]]
- [[Clean lines|Lineart]]
- [[Picking a size]]

You could also have a look at [[Newbie mistakes]] to at least have a brief understanding of what you should avoid doing.

Have fun and, most importantly, don't give up halfway in!
