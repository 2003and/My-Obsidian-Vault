Have you ever looked on some games or works and felt like they are not very good, but you couldn't put your finger on why exactly? That can be because some parts sprites simply don't fit together, even if separately they're well made. Luckily for you here are some ways you can help compensate it!
Here's a list (because I like lists :D)
- Use a single [[Palette making|palette]] for the entire project[^1] - one way the sprites may look out of place is when they're made using different palettes. This is a problem, because different palettes have different "feels" inside of them, and that's why a sprite made in a dark and desaturated palette CAN and WILL look out of place on a pastel background
- Use similar shapes in sprites[^1] - this might sound a bit vague... Let's put it this way: if you draw spiky grass - the tree foliage should also be spiky, if the grass is rounded/clumped - the foliage is also rounded/clumped. Same goes for stuff like rocks, fur, clouds, glass bottles, humans, and literally everything else - drawing is truly a very loose and subjective topic, so it's up to YOU to decide how will you draw those precious glass bottles: round or blocky? Translucent or mat? Blue-ish or yellow-ish?
- Check your [[Shading|light sources]][^2] - sometimes things look out of place because the artist missed out on the light source's position, and now the house has highlights on one side, and the lamp pole has them on the other side
>[!note] Side note
>About different highlighted sides - they CAN be present on a drawing, but only if there is a powerful light source near the object #todo move it to the [[Shading]] note
- Use your common sense[^3] - this problem is usually more obvious than the previous ones: why would a lamp post be turned on during daytime? How did the fish end up flying through the sky? Why is there a blossoming tree in the middle of the Antarctic??? If it doesn't make sense in your picture - fix it! Add a turned off lamp post into the tileset, erase the flying fish from the sky - see how simple the solution is?

[^1]: ![[Inconsistent palette and forms.png]] The farthest left tree stands out both because of the palette and the form!
[^2]: ![[Different light sources.png]] This lamp pole is highlighted from the right, and the house is highlighted from the left.
