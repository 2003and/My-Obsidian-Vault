A line in pixelart is considered clean if it follows a specific pattern and lacks [[Doubles|doubles]] or [[Jaggies|jaggies]].
>[!note]
>Sometimes a straight ladder might be either too acute or too blunt, then you can kind of use a pattern of type 2,1,2,1,2,1,..., which _can_ be considered clean, although it doesn't look as clean as a 2,2,2,... or 1,1,1,... Still, [[AntiAliasing]] can help the line look cleaner!
