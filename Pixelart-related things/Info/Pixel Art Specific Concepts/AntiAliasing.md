AntiAliasing (also sometimes referred to as "AA") is a technique used to simulate smoother curves in pixel art's low resolution. This effect is achieved by choosing a middle tone between the colors of the two aliased [[Clusters|pixel clusters]] or lines and placing pixels in places where "fractional pixels" would be put if they existed in the first place. [^1] (very weird explanation, I know. Don't worry - later on you will understand everything!)

This basic concept is used practically in any pixel art piece, be it a cat sprite or a study of Da Vinci's Joconda - because of the limited resolution sometimes lines and shapes feel a bit too jagged or not smooth enough. But, with the help of Anti Aliasing, we can slightly tweak the shape's border to create an illusion of smoothly flowing lines.[^2]
Another problem Anti Aliasing is very useful for fixing are [[Jaggies|jagged lines]]. Even though pixel artists usually avoid using jaggies, sometimes the [[Clean lines|"staircase" patterns]] just don't work and you are forced to use jagged lines. And Anti Aliasing is very useful for this problem. [^3]

>Don't get too excited - too much Anti Aliasing will result in a blurry picture with low readabilty. So, you may go crazy, but be ready to step on the brakes at some point.
