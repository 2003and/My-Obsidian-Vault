Stylized dithering is an advanced technique built upon [[Dithering]]. The main difference from dithering is the fact of modifying the pattern in a way to create a different texture[^2] feel.

The first example of stylized dithering usage that comes to mind is drawing foliage![^1] Sure, you could use your ol' and reliable checkerboard pattern, but using a pattern that looks like leaves will certainly look more eye appealing (although don't take my words as a dogma - it always depends on the context. The sprite scale is one of the main factors here)
If done properly, stylized dithering could even be used to simulate real life hachure - it's that much powerful.

Three of a million possible patterns for stylized dithering (1: bubbles; 2: hachure stylization; 3: foliage)

Here is an example how I used stylized dithering on Bolty's staches to simulate brushed fluff (Pardon me for such a shameless self-insert)
