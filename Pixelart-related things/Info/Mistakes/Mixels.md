Mixels is a term for pixels that are inconsistently sized
One example of a mixel occurrence is when the artist upscales the image by an uneven amount [^1] (where 200%,300%,455%, etc. are considered even, and 150%, 225%, etc. are considered uneven)
Another example is when a beginner artist intentionally starts using differently sized pixels [^2] (although they look proportional, this situation usually still makes the work look unprofessional)
And one more less common example of mixels is when the artist draws in resolution waaay higher than intended for some reason [^3]
An extra example where that is actually surprisingly common are indie games [^4]

>Although it looks... out of place (in best cases), when seen in static pixel art, it still has an important role in animations! Take smears and motion blurs for example - it's fine if inbetween frames there are a couple of mixels occurrecnces.

the outline and base of the ship is made out of pixels twice larger of those used for detailing

The image is created in high resolution and thus imperfections can be seen (the first square is positioned slightly higher, the second square has gaps to it's sides and the fourth square is positioned slightly lower)

here you can see that the character's sprite resolution is about... 5-10 times smaller that the one of the car's sprite. Sorry, I'm too lazy to perform calculations
